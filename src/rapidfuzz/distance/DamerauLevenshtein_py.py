def distance(s1, s2, *, processor=None, score_cutoff=None):
    """
    Calculates the minimum number of insertions and deletions
    required to change one sequence into the other. This is equivalent to the
    Levenshtein distance with a substitution weight of 2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : Sequence[Hashable]
        First string to compare.
    s2 : Sequence[Hashable]
        Second string to compare.
    processor: callable, optional
        Optional callable that is used to preprocess the strings before
        comparing them. Default is None, which deactivates this behaviour.
    score_cutoff : int, optional
        Maximum distance between s1 and s2, that is
        considered as a result. If the distance is bigger than score_cutoff,
        score_cutoff + 1 is returned instead. Default is None, which deactivates
        this behaviour.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : int
        distance between s1 and s2

    Examples
    --------
    Find the Damerau Levenshtein distance between two strings:

    >>> from rapidfuzz.distance import DamerauLevenshtein
    >>> DamerauLevenshtein.distance("lewenstein", "levenshtein")
    3

    Setting a maximum distance allows the implementation to select
    a more efficient implementation:

    >>> DamerauLevenshtein.distance("lewenstein", "levenshtein", score_cutoff=1)
    2

    Parameters
    ----------
