## [0.3.0] - 2020 Mar 26

### Changed

- When using score_cutoff there is now a guarantee that it returns 0 when result < score_cutoff
- each function has now a preprocess argument to specify whether strings should be preprocessed
- the default preprocessing does now lower case and trim
- extract and extractOne accept a custom processor method instead of utils.default_processor now

### Removed
