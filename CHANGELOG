## [0.4.0] - 2020 Mar 29

### Added
- levenshtein module that provides access to
  - weighted distance
  - normalized weighted distance

  - normalized distance

### Fixed
- extract returned a list of tuples of empty string and 0 when not enough elements had a ratio
  bigger than score_cutoff
- fix wrong sorting of results causing wrong results to be removed in extract


## [0.3.2] - 2020 Mar 29

### Added
- Readded QRatio as alias for ratio to stay conform with fuzzywuzzy
- add extractBests process as alias for extract since it is a better name for it

### Changed
- When using score_cutoff there is now a guarantee that it returns 0 when result < score_cutoff
- each function has now a preprocess argument to specify whether strings should be preprocessed
