RapidFuzz Installation
=====================================

RapidFuzz can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/rapidfuzz/>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install rapidfuzz

There are pre-built binaries (wheels) for ``RapidFuzz`` and its dependencies for MacOS (10.9 and later), Linux x86_64 and Windows.

For any other architecture/OS, ``RapidFuzz`` can be installed from the source distribution. To do so, a C++14 capable compiler must be installed before running the ``pip install rapidfuzz`` command. While Linux and MacOs usually come with a compiler it is required to install `C++-Buildtools <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`_ on Windows.
